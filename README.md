# Python


Hello Everyone!

This repo is meant to provide programmers with values insights into the usage of Python. A lot of times people may encounter bugs in the development of python scripts for different tasks. Having a more in-depth understanding of Python can help professionals not only improve their current project methodology but also facilitate their future development. 

As a data scientist and M.S. in Business Analytics Candidate at UCLA, I realize the significance of understanding different business practices and also knowing the ins and outs of Python. Therefore, I would like to summarize special things about Python that I encounter during my career in a jupyter notebook. 

In this notebook, I will include syntaxes and examples that Python programmers should know in order to become a succesful data analyst / scientist in the future. And I will update the jupyter notebook regularly. 

Please feel free to click on the "watch" and "star" buttons. Or you can even leave a comment if you find this helpful.

Happy Coding!
